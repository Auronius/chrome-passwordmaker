# Chrome Passwordmaker

The only thing that kept me from switching to chrome completly was a missing port of the passwormaker.org
extension. Luckly there is one available right now in the (extension directory)[https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/doblembglfahhpiilfhajboogopikhcm].
Sadly that extension is only a simple port of the html page that is offered on passwordmaker.org.

This extension tries to make a real port. One with heart and soul.
